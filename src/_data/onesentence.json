        "review": "The decision to split the <em>Rocinante</em>'s crew and follow their individual paths, especially Amos' visit to Earth and the wonderfully disfunctional relationship between Filip and his father, initially gave me pause, but paid off immensely, especially with the nail-biter of the protomolecule coup.",

        "review": "While I might raise the criticism of the book being a bit wordy at times, and Voss' examples a bit too extreme for the everyday negotiator, <em>Never Split the Difference</em> became an invaluable tool in a salary negotiation which ended up giving me the highest raise of my life.",

        "review": "<em>Ideaflow</em> is the prime example of a non-fiction book that is not devoid of interesting insights, but could have communicated the same concepts on about a quarter of the length.",

        "genre": "‚öîÔ∏è Fantasy",
        "review": "I got the vague feeling that Butcher wanted to set one of the Dresden novels in the adult entertainment milieu for *ages* and finally gathered up the courage to do so, but I have to concede it resulted in one of the most entertaining and action-packed stories about the Chicago wizard, owed in great parts to the interesting concept of the White Court and the action movie stereotype that is Kincaid.",
